- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
  > :information_source: You can use an emoji, only before the Title-Cased Description.
- When adding to the `Product Managers to Follow` category, please add a link to their Blog and Twitter without breaking the table

- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- New categories or improvements to the existing `Table of Contents` are welcome.
